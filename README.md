# 🌌 Astrel

**Astrel** is a next-generation, multi-language testing framework built around one idea:

> **Testing should be effortless.**

No boilerplate. No painful setup. No framework lock-in.  
Just write tests and run them — in **any language**.

---

## ✨ Why Astrel?

Most testing frameworks assume:
- You already know their philosophy
- You’ll adapt your project around them
- You’re okay with heavy config

**Astrel flips that.**

Astrel adapts to **you**.

- 🧠 Zero-friction setup
- 🌍 Multi-language support
- ⚡ Instant execution
- 🔌 Drop-in integration for existing projects
- 🧪 Opinion-light, productivity-heavy
